I'm currently a MS Student at UNC-Chapel Hill studying Statistics and Operations Research [(UNC STOR)](http://stat-or.unc.edu) with
a concentration in Machine Learning. This summer I was a Data Science Intern at FinTech startup, [Spreedly](http://spreedly.com), where
I built a Lead Scoring model using machine learning techniques. 

Prior to returning to grad school, I was a Statistician at [RTI International](http://rti.org) where I provided statistical support to clients including
the Centers for Disease Control, Department of Education and the Department of Justice, primarily in the area of survey statistics. Before
that I was an analyst in the IT department of [Navy Federal Credit Union](http://navyfederal.org) and the Operations department of
non-profit [CRU](http://www.cru.org). My undergraduate degree was in Statistics from the University of Connecticut, bringing my schools'
Men's basketball national championship total to 10 and counting :)
