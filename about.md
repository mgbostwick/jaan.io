Currently I'm an MS Student at UNC-Chapel Hill studying Statistics and Operations Research [(UNC STOR)](http://stat-or.unc.edu) with
a concentration in Machine Learning. I'm developing a deep understanding of how and why quantitative techniques
work so that I can effectively apply them to complex business problems. My interests include explanatory and predictive modeling, coding in 
R and Python, and data visualization.

This past summer I was a Data Science Intern at FinTech startup, [Spreedly](http://spreedly.com), where I built a Lead Scoring model using 
machine learning techniques. Prior to returning to grad school, I worked on survey statistics for clients including the Centers for Disease Control, 
the Department of Education and the Department of Justice as a Statistician at [RTI International](http://rti.org).
Before that I was an analyst in the IT department of [Navy Federal Credit Union](http://navyfederal.org) and the Operations team of
non-profit [CRU](http://www.cru.org). I have a BS in Statistics from the University of Connecticut.
